                                        A Chargeback shall mean a Transaction that is uncollectible and returned to Service Provider/ Apnafaydaa by User/ Payee or acquiring bank for a refund to the concerned Payer / User due to any of the following reasons:
                                        <br />
                                        a) Any payment which the User/ Payer refuses to honour or demands a refund of because the Products or services, purchased or sold or the delivery thereof, was not as promised or was defective, deficiency of service, incomplete and /or unsatisfactory for any reason whatsoever, or that payment for the same has already been made.
                                        <br /> 
                                        b) Any payments by a User/ Payer using the Services, which is returned by the acquiring bank for any reason whatsoever.

                                        d) Any Transaction that is unsuccessful.
                                        <br /> 
                                        As a result of the rapid nature of movements of funds, once a payment has been initiated through the Services, it may not be possible to retract the same using the Services. Hence neither the Acquiring Bank or Apnafaydaa shall be responsible to the User or any one else for chargeback or refund. The user hereby expressly acknowledges and confirms that Aquapay shall not be liable for the Chargeback
                                        <br />
                                        Any such retraction of a payment shall be between user and payee directly and a chargeback can be considered only if the Payee refunds the amount back.
                                        <br />
                                        In the event of a Chargeback situation arising in case of any Products or services purchased by a User or Payer, for which payment has not yet been made to the Payee or User, the User or Payer shall be advised by Apnafaydaa to resolve the issue with the Payee or User at the earliest and Apnafaydaa shall then settle the payment in accordance with the solution agreed upon by the Parties once the same is communicated to Aquapay.
                                        <br />
                                        In any event, chargeback request may be entertained only if the payee refunds the amount and hence Apnafaydaa is under no obligation otherwise.
                                        <br />
                                        In the event of a Chargeback situation arising in case of any Products purchased by a User/ Payer, for which payment has been made to the Payee/User / Service Provider, the User/ Payer shall be advised to resolve the issue with the Payee/User / Service Provider at the earliest and shall then settle the payment in accordance with the solution agreed upon by the Parties only if the Payee refunds the amounts back .
